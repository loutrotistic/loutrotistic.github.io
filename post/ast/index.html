Abstract Syntax Tree is a data structure to represent the structure of a program. It is a tree representation of the abstract syntax structure of text written in a formal language.

We call this structure &ldquo;Abstract&rdquo; because it does not show every details appearing in the original syntax." />

<p>Here I will present to you the results of my research on AST, which helped me to solve the <a href="https://www.root-me.org/fr/Challenges/Web-Client/AST-Deobfuscation">AST Deobfuscation</a> challenge on RootMe.</p>
<p>Abstract Syntax Tree is a data structure to represent the structure of a program. It is a tree representation of the abstract syntax structure of text written in a formal language.</p>
<p><img src="assets/AST1.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>We call this structure &ldquo;Abstract&rdquo; because it does not show every details appearing in the original syntax.</p>
<p><img src="assets/AST2.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Converting a program in AST is very useful for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiling to Machine Code</li>
<li>Code Optimization</li>
<li>Bug Detection</li>
<li>Advanced Deobfuscation</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>The RootMe challenge wasn&rsquo;t a deobfuscation using AST or a deobfuscation of the AST itself, but simply a translation of the AST into executable code.</p>
<p>After the translation, we obtain a cryptographic function that, upon execution, returns the flag.</p>
